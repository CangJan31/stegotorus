- You need to generate some payloads which has that type, you may want to use pgenfake for that. Run pgenfake. The files will be crated in traces folder.

- in http.cc in http_steg_t::transmit_room and http_steg_t::transmit_room set the type to the type you are checking before the switch statement.

    type = HTTP_CONTENT_HTML;
    log_debug(conn, "checking available capacity for type %u", type);
    switch (type)

- Run stegotorus and check if it works:

./stegotorus --log-min-severity=debug --timestamp-logs chop server 127.0.0.1:5001 127.0.0.1:5000 http

./stegotorus_c --log-min-severity=debug --timestamp-logs chop client 127.0.0.1:4999 127.0.0.1:5000 http

- Run a socks server on 5001
  ssh -ND 5001 localhost

- test if you can read something
  curl -x socks4://127.0.0.1:4999 google.com

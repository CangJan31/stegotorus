go to stegossidea folder
open stegossidea/spiders/cover_spider.py

edit start_urls ad allowed_domains to reflect your cover providers

then in the stegossidea's root type

scrapy crawl stego_cover -o outputs.csv -t csv

copy the file in stegotorus/apache_payload

delete stegotorus/apache_payload/server_list.txt

NOT REALLY? You need curlftps install for stegotorus to be able to scrap the covers for capacity computation
